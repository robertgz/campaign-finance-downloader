Option A:
1. Get list of election dates
2. For an election date get a list of filers for that election. Each 'Filer Name' should be unique in the list.
  The Filer Name may be a committee name or the name of an individual. Both the committee name and the individual will be listed.
3. For a filer get a list of forms filed. No unique ID is available from the form list.
4. For each item in the form list get a xls file if available. An xls file has a single with transactions. 
  The transactions are likely associated with the filing of the form. The sheet has a field for Filer_ID but not filing ID.

Notes:
The forms of some filers do not have a xls available while the same form # from other filers do! The 496 forms may be from committees doing expenditures to support/oppose. Could they be state committees?
A form listed under the candidate name rather than the committee name can include independent expenditures by state committees. The forms listed in STHosting are scanned images of state forms. A 'similar' filing can be found in th estate system. The state filling is slightly different in that the office ought does not include the location.
Example: 
  State 496 on 05/07/2022
    Name: Kelly Martinez
    Office: Sheriff
  County scanned form (image in PDF)
    Name: Kelly Martinez
    Office: Sheriff San Diego County
